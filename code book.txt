Getting and Cleaning Data - peer assessment project

###Description of variables.

Data:  stores the funtion which reads in data from varoius folders.

imported_y_data: stores data read in from folder which contain a "y" in them.

imported_subject_data: stoes data from a folder with the name "subject" in them.

features_data: stores data from the features.txt file.

imported_x_data: stores data read in from folder which contain a "x" in them. Note this variable is modified later in the script- with means and std dev added to it.

subsetted_data:  this varible stores the output of the grep'd means and std devs.

read test data: stores the "test" funtion.

read_train_data: stores the read train funtion.

mergedataset: stores the function which combines "read_test_data" and "read_train_data"

activitylabs: stores the function which reads the activity labels data in and merges it with "imported_x-Data"

post_melt: stores reformatted data


### Descrition of Scope

Given:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.

Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

Its activity label.

An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Will need to:

After setting the source directory for the files, read in the following:

features.txt, activity_labels.txt, subject_train.txt, x_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, x_test.txt, y_test.txt

Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.

Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Merge data subset with the activityType table to cinlude the descriptive activity names

Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.

Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.

Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
